This Python code does the same thing as the Bash script:

It generates a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100.
It prints each number and identifies whether it's even or odd.
It calculates the sum of even and odd numbers, as well as the maximum and minimum numbers.
Finally, it prints out the results.
